    "We can see where the poles and zeroes are in the z-plane by looking at the spectral plots that are made from poles and zeroes.

For filters with poles and zeroes, the stability and frequency response are based on where the unit circle is in relation to the poles and zeroes. For filters with numerator and denominator factors, on the other hand, frequencies at the unit circle are equal to the Nyquist frequency and change the frequency response of the filter.\n",

    "A method called \"plot_ImpulseResponse\" shows the impulse response of a digital filter over time in the form of an impulse input signal. The function shows how the filter works in the time domain by showing the numerator coefficients, which are the impulse response, against time indices. But this method depends on the system being stable and not having any poles in the base of the transfer function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the transfer function has poles in the minimum, the function's method might not work because the system might become unstable. Filters with poles in the denominator can have impulse responses that are either infinite or not defined at all. This makes plotting the impulse response useless and doesn't tell you much about how the filter works. Because of this, you should be careful when using the \"plot_ImpulseResponse\" method, especially with filters that have complicated transfer functions."
